# m01l02-07 · A script that refuses to run on an old bash

**Lesson:** [Which Shell Am I In, And Getting Bash Five](https://learnsome.tech/learn/bash-course/m01l02) (lesson 1.2, module 1: The Shell And The Command Line) · Free  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You will be able to check your current shell and its version, and know how to get bash five.

## Files

- [`starter/needs-bash-four.sh`](starter/needs-bash-four.sh): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- 23 files of the course's shared working tree (`shared/fixtures/`), copied in beside the starter when the lab runs
- [`expected.txt`](expected.txt): the output the check compares with
- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m01l02/m01l02-07/starter`
2. Read `needs-bash-four.sh` the way the lesson builds it:
   - Lines 1–3: compare the first element
   - Lines 4–6: say so and exit
   - Lines 7–10: the rest of the script
3. Run it: `bash needs-bash-four.sh`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m01l02-07`.

## Expected output

```text
associative arrays work here: ada
```

## How to check

`./check m01l02-07` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `bash needs-bash-four.sh` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output and standard error are compared line by line, blank lines in the middle included (in shell output they are content); only spaces at the end of a line and the blank lines before the first and after the last line of output are set aside. A pass here is a pass on the site.
